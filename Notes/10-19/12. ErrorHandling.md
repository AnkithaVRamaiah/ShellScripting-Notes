# Error Handling and Debugging

Error handling and debugging are crucial practices in scripting, ensuring that your scripts run smoothly and are easy to maintain. Let’s break down these concepts in simple terms, along with some practical examples and minor details.

## Handling Errors in Shell Scripts

Error handling is about anticipating possible problems in your script and making sure the script can deal with them gracefully, instead of just failing abruptly. It also helps in providing useful error messages to the user, so they can understand what went wrong.

### How to Handle Errors:

#### Exit Status Codes:
In Unix-like systems, every command returns an exit status code when it completes. A status of 0 indicates success, while any non-zero value indicates an error.

Example:
```bash
command
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "The command failed"
fi
```
Here, `$?` holds the exit status of the last executed command. If it's not 0, it prints an error message.

#### Using `set -e`:
This command automatically stops the script execution if any command returns a non-zero exit status.

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
echo "This will run"
non_existing_command  # This will stop the script
echo "This will not run"
```
`set -e` ensures that if a command fails, the script terminates immediately.

#### Custom Error Messages:
Instead of letting your script fail without explanation, you can print clear messages to help debug issues.

Example:
```bash
if ! command; then
  echo "Error: The command failed!" >&2  # Redirects the error message to stderr
  exit 1  # Exit with a custom error code
fi
```
This prints an error message and exits with a status code of 1.

#### Using `trap` to Catch Errors:
The `trap` command can be used to handle errors by catching them and executing a specific command, such as logging an error or performing cleanup tasks.

Example:
```bash
trap 'echo "An error occurred!"' ERR
```
This sets up an error handler to display the message "An error occurred!" if any command in the script fails.

## Debugging Scripts

Debugging helps to identify why a script is not behaving as expected. It involves running the script in a controlled way to find the issues.

### How to Debug Shell Scripts:

#### Using `set -x`:
This option allows you to see each command and its arguments as they are executed.

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -x
echo "This is a test"
non_existing_command
set +x  # Turn off debugging
```
The `set -x` option prints each command to the terminal with its arguments, helping to trace the execution flow.

#### Using `set -v`:
This option prints each line of the script as it is executed.

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -v
echo "Debugging"
ls
```
`set -v` will print each line before it is executed, allowing you to see exactly what is happening in the script.

#### Adding `echo` Statements:
Sometimes, you need to manually print values to help identify issues.

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
variable="hello"
echo "The value of the variable is: $variable"
```
You can print variable values or outputs of commands at different points in the script to understand what’s going wrong.

#### Using a Debugger (Bash Debugger - bashdb):
`bashdb` is a debugger that provides step-by-step execution for debugging bash scripts. It allows you to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and navigate through your script.

You can install `bashdb` and use commands like:
```bash
bashdb script.sh
```

#### Error Logs and Trace Files:
You can direct error messages to a log file to keep track of what happened when a script fails.

Example:
```bash
command > output.log 2>&1
```
This redirects both standard output and error output to the `output.log` file.

#### Checking Syntax:
Syntax errors can cause scripts to fail, and it's helpful to check for them. You can use `bash -n` to check for syntax errors without running the script.

Example:
```bash
bash -n script.sh
```

## Best Practices for Error Handling and Debugging:

### Keep Error Messages Clear:
Provide clear and meaningful error messages so users and developers can understand what went wrong.

### Don’t Ignore Errors:
Avoid using `command || true` or similar tricks to silently ignore errors. Handling them properly gives you control over script behavior.

### Test Incrementally:
Run your script frequently during development to catch errors early. Test small parts of your script rather than running everything at once.

### Use Version Control:
Keep track of changes with version control systems like Git. This allows you to roll back if a new change introduces an error.

### Write Robust Scripts:
Consider edge cases, such as missing files or incorrect inputs, and handle them in your script to ensure that they don’t cause unexpected behavior.

### Example of a Robust Script with Error Handling and Debugging:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e  # Exit the script if any command fails
set -x  # Show each command as it runs

echo "Starting the script"
if ! command1; then
  echo "Error: command1 failed" >&2
  exit 1
fi

echo "Running command2"
command2 || { echo "Error: command2 failed" >&2; exit 1; }

echo "Script completed successfully"
```
This script uses both `set -e` and `set -x` for error handling and debugging. It includes custom error messages and ensures that if any command fails, the script stops with an appropriate error message.

## Summary:
- **Error Handling** helps you manage issues in your script by using exit codes, custom messages, and control mechanisms like `set -e` and `trap`.
- **Debugging** involves identifying problems by using `set -x`, `set -v`, or manually inserting `echo` statements.
- Following best practices like clear error messages, regular testing, and using version control will make your scripts more reliable and easier to troubleshoot.

By handling errors and debugging efficiently, you can ensure that your scripts are robust, easy to maintain, and less prone to failure.
