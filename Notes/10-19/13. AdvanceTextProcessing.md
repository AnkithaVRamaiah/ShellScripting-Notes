# Advanced Text Processing

In software development, processing and manipulating text efficiently is a crucial skill, especially for tasks like filtering logs, extracting information from files, or cleaning data. The three primary tools for advanced text processing in Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) are `grep`, `awk`, and `sed`. These tools, when combined with regular expressions (regex), allow for powerful text manipulation and filtering. Let’s break them down:

## `grep` (Global Regular Expression Print)
**Purpose**: `grep` is used for searching specific patterns or strings in files or input streams. It’s one of the most common tools used in Unix/Linux for searching and filtering text based on patterns.

### Basic Usage:
```
grep 'pattern' filename
```
Searches for the given pattern inside the file `filename` and displays the matching lines.

### Example:
```
grep 'error' logfile.txt
```
This searches for the word "error" in `logfile.txt` and prints the lines containing that word.

### Options:
- `-i`: Case-insensitive search (matches `Error`, `error`, etc.)
- `-r`: Search recursively in directories.
- `-v`: Invert match (display lines that do not match the pattern).
- `-l`: Print only filenames that match the pattern.

### Example:
```
grep -i 'error' logfile.txt
```
This searches for "error" regardless of case.

## `awk` (Pattern Scanning and Processing Language)
**Purpose**: `awk` is a full-fledged text processing tool, more advanced than `grep`. It works by reading the input line-by-line, splitting it into fields, and then performing actions on those fields. It’s often used for tasks like extracting columns from a file or performing calculations.

### Basic Syntax:
```
awk 'pattern {action}' filename
```
- `pattern`: Defines the condition to search for (optional).
- `{action}`: Specifies the action to take when the pattern matches.

### Example:
```
awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt
```
This prints the first and third columns of each line in `file.txt`.

### Common Fields:
- `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, ... : Represent the first, second, third, etc., fields of a line.
- `$0`: Represents the entire line.

### Example with condition:
```
awk '$3 > 100 {print $1, $3}' file.txt
```
This prints the first and third columns of lines where the third column is greater than 100.

## `sed` (Stream Editor)
**Purpose**: `sed` is a stream editor used for modifying and transforming text in a file or input stream. It can be used for simple tasks like replacing text, deleting lines, or inserting new lines.

### Basic Syntax:
```
sed 'command' filename
```
- `command`: Specifies the operation to perform.

### Example (substitute):
```
sed 's/old_text/new_text/' file.txt
```
This replaces the first occurrence of `old_text` with `new_text` in each line of `file.txt`.

### Common `sed` Commands:
- `s/old/new/`: Substitute `old` with `new`.
- `d`: Delete the matching line.
- `p`: Print lines (often used with `-n` to suppress the default output).

### Example (delete line):
```
sed '3d' file.txt
```
This deletes the third line of `file.txt`.

### Example (replace all occurrences):
```
sed 's/old_text/new_text/g' file.txt
```
This replaces all occurrences of `old_text` with `new_text` in `file.txt`.

---

## Regular Expressions (Regex)
**Purpose**: Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. They are used in `grep`, `awk`, and `sed` to identify specific text sequences.

### Basic Syntax:
- `.`: Matches any single character except newline.
- `*`: Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element.
- `^`: Anchors the match to the start of a line.
- `$`: Anchors the match to the end of a line.
- `[]`: Matches any one of the enclosed characters.
- `|`: OR operator for alternative patterns.
- `\`: Escape special characters.

### Example (matching any line that starts with "error"):
```
grep '^error' logfile.txt
```
This searches for lines that begin with "error".

### Example (matching a number):
```
grep '^[0-9]*$' file.txt
```
This searches for lines that consist only of numbers.

## Text Manipulation and Filtering
By combining the tools mentioned above, you can efficiently manipulate and filter text to extract the required data. Here's how:

### Filter columns with `awk`:
```
awk '{print $1, $3}' data.txt
```
This extracts and prints the first and third columns from a space-separated file.

### Use `grep` and `sed` together:
```
grep 'error' logfile.txt | sed 's/error/ERR/'
```
This searches for the word "error" in `logfile.txt` and replaces it with "ERR".

### Remove empty lines with `sed`:
```
sed '/^$/d' file.txt
```
This deletes all empty lines from `file.txt`.

### Count the occurrences of a pattern with `grep`:
```
grep -c 'pattern' file.txt
```
This counts the number of lines containing "pattern".

## Summary:
- `grep` is for searching and filtering lines based on patterns.
- `awk` is for manipulating structured text, especially for extracting and processing columns of data.
- `sed` is for editing text, such as replacing text, deleting lines, and more.

Using these tools together with regular expressions allows for powerful and flexible text processing and manipulation, especially in Unix/Linux environments. These tools are widely used in shell scripting, log analysis, and data cleaning tasks.
