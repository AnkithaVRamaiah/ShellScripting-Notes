# Interacting with Other Programs

In scripting, particularly in shell scripts or automation scripts, interacting with other programs is a vital aspect. This allows you to leverage the functionality of external applications, libraries, or services to make your script more powerful. You can use external commands, APIs, and web services to extend the capabilities of your script.

## Using External Commands in Scripts

External commands are commands that exist outside of your script but can be executed by the script. These can be standard operating system commands (like `ls`, `ps`, `df`, etc.) or third-party software (like `curl`, `git`, etc.).

### How to Use External Commands in Shell Scripts

You simply call the external command in your script as you would from the command line. Here are a few examples:

### Running System Commands:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Using the ls command to list directory contents
ls -l /home/user/
```

### Using Commands with Output

You can capture the output of a command into a variable:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Storing the output of date command in a variable
current_date=$(date)
echo "Today's date is: $current_date"
```

### Using Commands in Pipelines

You can chain multiple commands together using pipes (`|`), allowing one command's output to be used as input for the next:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Using ps to list processes and grep to find a specific one
ps aux | grep "my_program"
```

### Checking Command Exit Status

Every command in a script returns an exit status. A successful command returns 0, and a failed command returns a non-zero value. You can check this using `$?`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Running a command and checking if it was successful
echo "Running a test command"
ls /some/directory
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Command successful"
else
  echo "Command failed"
fi
```

## Integrating with APIs and Web Services

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and web services allow your script to communicate with other software or services over the network. For example, you might want your script to fetch data from a web service or send data to an API.

### How to Integrate with APIs in Shell Scripts

#### Using `curl` for HTTP Requests

`curl` is a command-line tool used to interact with URLs, which is commonly used to communicate with web APIs.

##### Making a GET Request:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Fetching data from a public API
response=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/users/octocat)
echo "Response: $response"
```

##### Making a POST Request:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Sending data to an API
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Ankita"}' https://example.com/api/users
```

#### Using `wget` for Downloading Data

`wget` is another tool used to download files or interact with APIs. It's especially useful for downloading files or content from the web.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Downloading a file from the internet
wget https://example.com/file.zip
```

#### Interacting with APIs Using Authentication

Some APIs require authentication, which can be done via an API key or token. This is often passed in the headers.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Accessing an API with an API Key
api_key="your_api_key_here"
response=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $api_key" https://api.example.com/data)
echo "API Response: $response"
```

### Types of API Requests

APIs typically support several types of HTTP requests:

- `GET`: Retrieve data from the API (e.g., fetching user information).
- `POST`: Send data to the API (e.g., submitting a form or creating a resource).
- `PUT`: Update existing data.
- `DELETE`: Delete data from the server.

##### Example of a GET Request to Fetch Data from an API:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example of a GET request
response=$(curl -s "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=your_api_key")
echo "Weather data: $response"
```

##### Example of a POST Request to Send Data to an API:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Sending user data to an API
response=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "ankita", "password": "secret"}' https://api.example.com/login)
echo "API Response: $response"
```

## Error Handling in API Integrations

When interacting with APIs, it's essential to handle potential errors, such as network issues or incorrect API responses. You can check the HTTP status code to determine the success or failure of the request.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Checking for HTTP errors after API request
response=$(curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -o /dev/null https://api.example.com/data)
http_code=$(echo $response | tail -n 1)

if [ "$http_code" -eq 200 ]; then
  echo "Request was successful"
else
  echo "Error occurred: HTTP $http_code"
fi
```

## Key Points to Remember

- **External Commands**: You can use any command available in your system or tools installed on your system by directly invoking them in your script. These can include file management commands (`ls`, `rm`, etc.), system monitoring commands (`top`, `ps`), or tools like `curl` for HTTP requests.
  
- **API Integration**: Using tools like `curl`, `wget`, or even specialized libraries in other languages (like Python or JavaScript) allows you to fetch or send data to a web service, enabling your script to interact with external systems and services.

- **Error Handling**: Always consider error handling when calling external commands or APIs to ensure that your script responds properly in case something goes wrong (e.g., a command fails or an API request returns an error).

This approach makes your scripts more versatile, allowing them to interact with external data, services, or systems and automate workflows that depend on real-time data or remote services.
