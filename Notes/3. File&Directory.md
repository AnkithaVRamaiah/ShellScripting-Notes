# File and Directory Manipulation

This refers to tasks that involve creating, moving, copying, renaming, and deleting files and directories (folders) on your computer.

## Common Commands:

- **`ls`**: Lists the files and directories in the current directory.

  - Example: `ls` – Shows all files in the current directory.
  - Example: `ls -l` – Shows detailed information like file size, permissions, etc.

- **`cd`**: Changes the current directory (folder).

  - Example: `cd /home/user/Documents` – Changes to the Documents folder.

- **`mkdir`**: Creates a new directory.

  - Example: `mkdir new_folder` – Creates a folder named "new_folder."

- **`rmdir`**: Removes an empty directory.

  - Example: `rmdir old_folder` – Removes the folder "old_folder."

- **`touch`**: Creates a new, empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.

  - Example: `touch file.txt` – Creates a new file named "file.txt."

- **`cp`**: Copies files or directories.

  - Example: `cp file.txt copy.txt` – Copies "file.txt" to "copy.txt."

- **`mv`**: Moves or renames files or directories.

  - Example: `mv old_name.txt new_name.txt` – Renames a file.

- **`rm`**: Removes (deletes) files or directories.

  - Example: `rm file.txt` – Deletes "file.txt."
  - Example: `rm -r directory_name` – Deletes a directory and its contents.

# Viewing File Contents

This refers to commands that allow you to look inside files to see their content.

## Common Commands:

- **`cat`**: Displays the content of a file.

  - Example: `cat file.txt` – Shows the content of "file.txt."

- **`more`**: Displays the content of a file, one page at a time (useful for long files).

  - Example: `more file.txt` – View the file in pages.

- **`less`**: Similar to more, but with more features like backward navigation.

  - Example: `less file.txt` – View the file with the ability to scroll up and down.

- **`head`**: Shows the first few lines of a file.

  - Example: `head file.txt` – Displays the first 10 lines of "file.txt."

- **`tail`**: Shows the last few lines of a file.

  - Example: `tail file.txt` – Displays the last 10 lines of "file.txt."

- **`nano`** or **`vim`**: Open a file for editing in a text editor.

  - Example: `nano file.txt` – Open "file.txt" in the nano editor.

# File Permissions

Every file or directory in Linux/Unix has permissions that control who can read, write, or execute the file. There are three types of users:

- **Owner**: The user who created the file.
- **Group**: Users who are in the same group as the file’s owner.
- **Others**: All other users.

## Common Commands to Manage Permissions:

- **`ls -l`**: Displays detailed file information, including permissions.

  - Example: `ls -l` might show something like this:

    ```
    -rwxr-xr-- 1 user group 4096 Jan 1 10:00 file.txt
    ```

    Here, `rwxr-xr--` are the permissions:

    - `r`: Read permission.
    - `w`: Write permission.
    - `x`: Execute permission.

    In the example:
    - The **owner** has read, write, and execute permissions (`rwx`).
    - The **group** has read and execute permissions (`r-x`).
    - **Others** have read-only permission (`r--`).

- **`chmod`**: Changes the file permissions.

  - Example: `chmod 755 file.txt`
    - `7`: Owner gets read, write, and execute (`rwx`).
    - `5`: Group gets read and execute (`r-x`).
    - `5`: Others get read and execute (`r-x`).

  You can also use symbolic notation:
  
  - Example: `chmod u+x file.txt` – Adds execute permission for the owner (`u` is for user/owner).

- **`chown`**: Changes the owner of a file or directory.

  - Example: `chown user file.txt` – Changes the owner of "file.txt" to "user."

- **`chgrp`**: Changes the group of a file or directory.

  - Example: `chgrp group file.txt` – Changes the group of "file.txt" to "group."

These commands are essential for navigating and managing files and directories, checking the contents of files, and controlling access permissions for security.
