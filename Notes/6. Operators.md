# 1. Arithmetic Operators

These are used to perform basic mathematical operations.

- **Addition (+)**: Adds two values.

  Example: `5 + 3` results in `8`.

- **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts one value from another.

  Example: `5 - 3` results in `2`.

- **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies two values.

  Example: `5 * 3` results in `15`.

- **Division (/)**: Divides one value by another and returns the result as a float (decimal).

  Example: `5 / 2` results in `2.5`.

- **Modulus (%)**: Returns the remainder of a division.

  Example: `5 % 2` results in `1` (since 5 divided by 2 gives a remainder of 1).

- **Exponentiation (**)**: Raises one value to the power of another.

  Example: `2 ** 3` results in `8` (2 raised to the power of 3).

# 2. Relational Operators

These are used to compare two values and return a boolean result (True or False).

- **Equal to (==)**: Checks if two values are equal.

  Example: `5 == 3` results in `False`, but `5 == 5` results in `True`.

- **Not equal to (!=)**: Checks if two values are not equal.

  Example: `5 != 3` results in `True`, but `5 != 5` results in `False`.

- **Greater than (>)**: Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.

  Example: `5 > 3` results in `True`.

- **Less than (<)**: Checks if the left value is less than the right value.

  Example: `5 < 3` results in `False`.

- **Greater than or equal to (>=)**: Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.

  Example: `5 >= 3` results in `True`.

- **Less than or equal to (<=)**: Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.

  Example: `5 <= 3` results in `False`.

# 3. Boolean Operators

These operators are used to combine multiple conditions and return a boolean result (True or False).

- **AND (&& or and)**: Returns `True` if both conditions are true.

  Example: `True && False` results in `False`, but `True && True` results in `True`.

- **OR (|| or or)**: Returns `True` if at least one condition is true.

  Example: `True || False` results in `True`, and `False || False` results in `False`.

- **NOT (! or not)**: Reverses the boolean value (`True` becomes `False` and vice versa).

  Example: `not True` results in `False`, and `not False` results in `True`.

# 4. String Operators

These operators are used to manipulate and compare strings.

- **Concatenation (+)**: Joins two strings together.

  Example: `'Hello' + ' World'` results in `'Hello World'`.

- **Repetition (*)**: Repeats the string a certain number of times.

  Example: `'Hello' * 3` results in `'HelloHelloHello'`.

- **Length (len())**: Finds the length (number of characters) of a string.

  Example: `len('Hello')` results in `5` (since there are 5 characters in `'Hello'`).

- **Comparison (==, !=, <, >)**: You can also compare strings using relational operators.

  Example: `'apple' == 'apple'` results in `True`, but `'apple' != 'apple'` results in `False`.

# Summary

- **Arithmetic Operators**: Perform mathematical calculations (addition, subtraction, etc.).
- **Relational Operators**: Compare values and return a boolean (True/False).
- **Boolean Operators**: Combine multiple conditions to return True or False.
- **String Operators**: Work with strings, including joining, repeating, and measuring length.

These operators form the foundation for performing most basic operations in programming, and they are essential for creating logical flows and calculations.
