# 3. Variables and Environment

In shell scripting, variables and environment variables are fundamental concepts that help you store and manipulate data in scripts or command-line environments. Here's a detailed explanation:

## 1. Declaring and Using Variables

Variables in shell scripting are used to store data values that can be used later in the script. These values can be strings, numbers, or even commands.

### Declaring a Variable:

To declare a variable, you don't need any special keyword like `int` or `string`. You simply write the name of the variable followed by an `=` sign and assign a value.

**Syntax:**

```
variable_name=value
```

**Note:**

- No spaces around the `=` sign.
- Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., `Variable` and `variable` are different).

**Example:**

```
name="John"
age=25
```

### Using a Variable:

To use the value of a variable, you refer to it by prefixing the variable name with a dollar sign (`$`).

**Syntax:**

```
echo $variable_name
```

**Example:**

```
echo $name   # Outputs: John
echo $age    # Outputs: 25
```

You can also combine variables in strings:

```
greeting="Hello"
echo "$greeting, $name!"   # Outputs: Hello, John!
```

## 2. Environment Variables

Environment variables are variables that exist outside of your script and are used to configure the environment your script runs in. These are set by the system or the user and are accessible by any process running in that environment. They typically contain information like system paths, user settings, and other configuration details.

### Common Environment Variables:

- `$HOME`: Path to the current userâ€™s home directory.
- `$USER`: The name of the currently logged-in user.
- `$PATH`: A colon-separated list of directories that the shell searches for executables.
- `$PWD`: The present working directory.
- `$SHELL`: The current shell being used (e.g., `/bin/bash`).

### Accessing Environment Variables:

To use an environment variable, you refer to it using `$`.

**Example:**

```
echo $HOME   # Outputs the path to the home directory
echo $PATH   # Outputs the system search paths for executables
```

### Setting Environment Variables:

You can set environment variables within a script or shell session using the `export` command:

```
export VARIABLE_NAME=value
```

**Example:**

```
export MY_VAR="Hello, World!"
echo $MY_VAR   # Outputs: Hello, World!
```

**Note:**

Environment variables set in a shell session or script only persist for the duration of that session unless they are added to configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`).

## 3. Special Variables

There are special variables in shell scripting that are used to refer to system values or script-related arguments. These special variables provide a way to interact with the environment in a script.

### Some common special variables:

- `$0`: The name of the script itself.
  
  ```
  echo $0   # Outputs the name of the script (e.g., my_script.sh)
  ```

- `$1`, `$2`, ..., `$N`: Positional parameters that refer to the arguments passed to the script. `$1` refers to the first argument, `$2` to the second, and so on.

  ```
  echo $1   # Outputs the first argument passed to the script
  echo $2   # Outputs the second argument passed to the script
  ```

- `$#`: The number of arguments passed to the script.

  ```
  echo $#   # Outputs the number of arguments passed to the script
  ```

- `$@`: All arguments passed to the script as a list.

  ```
  echo $@   # Outputs all the arguments passed to the script
  ```

- `$?`: The exit status of the last command executed. A value of 0 usually indicates success, and any other value indicates an error.

  ```
  echo $?   # Outputs the exit status of the last command
  ```

- `$$`: The process ID (PID) of the current script or shell.

  ```
  echo $$   # Outputs the PID of the current shell or script
  ```

- `$_`: The last argument of the previous command.

  ```
  echo $_   # Outputs the last argument of the previous command
  ```

## 4. Local vs Global Variables

Global variables are available throughout the script and can be accessed anywhere in the script.

Local variables are restricted to a function or block of code. They are useful to avoid accidental overwriting of global variables.

### To declare a local variable within a function:

```
function my_function {
  local my_var="local_value"
  echo $my_var
}

my_function   # Outputs: local_value
```

## Summary:

- Variables store data within a script and are accessed using the `$` sign.
- Environment variables are predefined variables that hold system or user-specific information and are used to configure the shell environment.
- Special variables provide additional functionality, such as referencing script arguments, exit statuses, or process IDs.

With these concepts, you can effectively handle data and interact with the system in your shell scripts!
