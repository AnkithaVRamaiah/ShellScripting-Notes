# Input and Output (I/O) in Shell Scripting

## 1. Echoing Output

In shell scripting, echoing output means displaying information to the terminal or console. You can use the `echo` command to print text, values of variables, or command outputs.

### Syntax:

```bash
echo "Your message here"
```

### Example:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, World!
```

You can also use variables inside `echo` to display dynamic information.

### Example:

```bash
name="Ankita"
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, Ankita!
```

### Special Characters:

- `\n` for a new line.
- `\t` for a tab space.
- `\b` for backspace.
- `\\` for a backslash.

### Example:

```bash
echo -e "Hello\nWorld!"
```

**Output:**

```
Hello
World!
```

## 2. Taking Input

In shell scripting, you often need to take input from the user. This is done using the `read` command, which allows you to capture user input and store it in a variable.

### Syntax:

```bash
read variable_name
```

### Example:

```bash
echo "Enter your name: "
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

When you run this script, it will prompt the user to enter their name. After entering the name, the script will display a greeting.

## 3. Redirecting Input/Output

Redirecting Input/Output means controlling where the input or output goes (either to a file or from a file) instead of the default terminal.

### 3.1 Redirecting Output

You can redirect the output of a command to a file instead of the terminal using the `>` operator. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten; if it doesnâ€™t, a new file will be created.

### Syntax:

```bash
command > filename
```

### Example:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!" > output.txt
```

This will create or overwrite `output.txt` with the string "Hello, World!".

To append output to a file without overwriting it, use `>>`:

```bash
echo "Appended text" >> output.txt
```

### 3.2 Redirecting Input

You can redirect input from a file to a command using the `<` operator.

### Syntax:

```bash
command < filename
```

### Example:

```bash
sort < input.txt
```

This will take the contents of `input.txt` and pass it as input to the `sort` command.

### 3.3 Pipes (`|`)

A pipe `|` allows you to send the output of one command as the input to another command.

### Syntax:

```bash
command1 | command2
```

### Example:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!" | tr "a-z" "A-Z"
```

This will convert the string to uppercase:

```
HELLO, WORLD!
```

### 3.4 Redirecting Both Input and Output

You can redirect both input and output simultaneously. Use `<` for input and `>` for output together.

### Example:

```bash
command < input.txt > output.txt
```

This will take input from `input.txt` and write the output to `output.txt`.

### 3.5 Using File Descriptors

- `>` redirects the standard output (STDOUT, file descriptor 1) to a file.
- `2>` redirects the standard error (STDERR, file descriptor 2) to a file.

### Example:

```bash
command > output.txt 2> error.txt
```

This will redirect STDOUT to `output.txt` and STDERR to `error.txt`.

To redirect both output and error to the same file:

```bash
command > output.txt 2>&1
```

## Key Concepts to Remember:

- `echo` is used to output text or variables to the terminal.
- `read` is used to take input from the user and store it in a variable.
- Redirection allows you to manipulate where the input and output of commands go (either to files or other commands).
- Pipes help connect commands so that the output of one command can be passed as input to another.

This concludes a simple breakdown of input and output concepts in shell scripting with examples and explanations for each.
