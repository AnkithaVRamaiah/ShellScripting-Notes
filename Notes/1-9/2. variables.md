# Variables and Environment in Shell Scripting

## 1. Declaring and Using Variables

In shell scripting, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated throughout the script.

### Declaring a Variable

To declare a variable, you simply assign a value to it using the `=` sign, without any spaces around it.

**Example:**
```bash
name="John"
age=30
```

### Using a Variable

To use the value stored in a variable, you precede the variable name with a `$`.

**Example:**
```bash
echo "Name: $name"
echo "Age: $age"
```

### Rules for Variables

- Variable names must start with a letter or underscore.
- They can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
- They are case-sensitive (`Name` and `name` are different).

## 2. Environment Variables

Environment variables are special variables that affect the behavior of the shell and user processes. They are typically set outside the script and can be accessed by any child process.

### Common Environment Variables

- `PATH`: Directories where the shell looks for executable files.
- `HOME`: The current user's home directory.
- `USER`: The current user's username.
- `PWD`: The current working directory.
- `SHELL`: The path to the user's shell.

### Setting Environment Variables

You can set an environment variable in the shell using the `export` command.

**Example:**
```bash
export MY_VARIABLE="Hello"
```

### Using Environment Variables

You can reference them just like regular variables.

**Example:**
```bash
echo "User: $USER"
echo "Home Directory: $HOME"
```

### Listing Environment Variables

You can list all environment variables using the `env` or `printenv` command.

**Example:**
```bash
env
```

## 3. Special Variables

Shell scripting also provides special variables that have predefined meanings and are used to control the script's execution or to retrieve information.

### Special Variable Examples

- `$0`: The name of the script.
- `$1`, `$2`, ...: The first, second, etc., command-line arguments passed to the script.
- `$#`: The number of command-line arguments.
- `$@`: All the command-line arguments as a single word.
- `$?`: The exit status of the last command executed.
- `$$`: The process ID of the current shell.
- `$!`: The process ID of the last background command.

### Using Special Variables

**Example script to demonstrate some special variables:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script Name: $0"
echo "First Argument: $1"
echo "Number of Arguments: $#"
echo "All Arguments: $@"
```

## Summary

- Variables are used to store data for use in the script.
- Environment Variables are global variables used by the system and processes.
- Special Variables provide information about the script's execution context.

Understanding how to declare, use, and manipulate these variables is crucial for writing effective shell scripts.
