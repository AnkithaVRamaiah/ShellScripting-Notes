# Conditionals in Bash Scripting

Conditionals are used in programming to make decisions based on certain conditions. They allow the program to execute different code blocks depending on whether a condition is true or false.

## If Statements

An `if` statement allows you to test a condition. If the condition is true, the code inside the `if` block runs. If the condition is false, it is skipped.

### Syntax:

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # Code to be executed if the condition is true
fi
```

### Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
x=5
if [ $x -gt 3 ]; then
    echo "x is greater than 3"
fi
```

### Explanation:

- `[ $x -gt 3 ]`: This checks if `x` is greater than 3.
- Since `x` is 5, the condition is true, so the program prints "x is greater than 3".

## Else and Elif

You can extend the `if` statement with `else` and `elif` (else if) to check additional conditions or provide an alternative if the condition is false.

- `else`: The `else` block runs when the condition in the `if` statement is false.
- `elif`: The `elif` block allows you to check multiple conditions. It’s like saying “if this condition is false, check this other condition”.

### Syntax:

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # Code if the condition is true
elif [ another_condition ]; then
    # Code if the second condition is true
else
    # Code if all conditions are false
fi
```

### Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
x=5
if [ $x -gt 10 ]; then
    echo "x is greater than 10"
elif [ $x -gt 3 ]; then
    echo "x is greater than 3 but less than or equal to 10"
else
    echo "x is less than or equal to 3"
fi
```

### Explanation:

- The first condition (`[ $x -gt 10 ]`) is false, so it checks the `elif` condition (`[ $x -gt 3 ]`).
- Since `x` is 5, the second condition is true, so it prints "x is greater than 3 but less than or equal to 10".

## Case Statement

The `case` statement is another way to handle multiple conditions. It is useful when you have several potential conditions to check, as it makes the code more readable than using many `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.

### Syntax:

```bash
case $variable in
    pattern1)
        # Code to execute if variable matches pattern1
        ;;
    pattern2)
        # Code to execute if variable matches pattern2
        ;;
    *)
        # Default code if no pattern matches
        ;;
esac
```

- `variable`: The value you want to compare.
- `pattern1`, `pattern2`: The possible values or patterns you want to match.
- `*`: A wildcard that represents any value not matched by the previous patterns (the default case).

### Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
fruit="apple"
case $fruit in
    "apple")
        echo "This is an apple"
        ;;
    "banana")
        echo "This is a banana"
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Unknown fruit"
        ;;
esac
```

### Explanation:

- The `fruit` variable is set to "apple".
- The `case` statement checks if `fruit` matches any of the patterns.
- Since it matches "apple", the output will be "This is an apple".

## Key Points to Remember:

- `if` statement is for testing a single condition.
- `else` provides an alternative if the `if` condition is false.
- `elif` allows you to check additional conditions if the first condition is false.
- `case` statement is ideal for handling multiple possible conditions, making the code cleaner when there are many conditions to check.

## Conditions in Bash:

Conditions are generally written inside square brackets (`[ condition ]`).

### Common Operators:

- **Comparison operators for numbers**:
  - `-eq` (equal to), `-ne` (not equal to), `-gt` (greater than), `-lt` (less than), `-ge` (greater than or equal to), `-le` (less than or equal to)
- **String comparison**:
  - `=` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `-z` (string is empty), `-n` (string is not empty)
- **File tests**:
  - `-e` (file exists), `-f` (file is a regular file), `-d` (directory exists), `-r` (readable), `-w` (writable), `-x` (executable)

### Example Using File Test:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
file="/path/to/file.txt"
if [ -e $file ]; then
    echo "File exists"
else
    echo "File does not exist"
fi
```

This checks if the file exists before attempting to perform any actions on it.

## Summary:

- Use `if` to check a single condition.
- Use `else` to provide a fallback if the `if` condition fails.
- Use `elif` for additional conditions.
- Use `case` when there are many potential matching patterns to check against.

These conditional statements are essential for controlling the flow of execution based on specific conditions, making your scripts more dynamic and powerful.
