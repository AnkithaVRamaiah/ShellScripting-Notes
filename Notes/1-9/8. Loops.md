# Loops in Programming

Loops are control structures in programming that allow code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition. Loops help to automate repetitive tasks, making programs more efficient. Let's break down the different types of loops and loop control statements.

## For Loop

A for loop is used when you know the number of iterations in advance. It repeats a block of code a specific number of times.

### Syntax:

```bash
for variable in list_of_values
do
    commands
done
```

- **variable**: Holds the current value from the list during each iteration.
- **list_of_values**: A range or set of values over which the loop iterates.

### Example:

```bash
for i in {1..5}
do
    echo "This is iteration $i"
done
```

**Explanation**:

This loop will run 5 times, with `i` taking values from 1 to 5. It prints the message with the current iteration number.

You can also use a for loop with a specific range of numbers:

```bash
for i in {1..10..2}
do
    echo $i
done
```

This will output:

```
1
3
5
7
9
```

Here `{1..10..2}` means starting from 1 to 10, incrementing by 2.

## While Loop

A while loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It is useful when you don't know in advance how many iterations you need.

### Syntax:

```bash
while condition
do
    commands
done
```

### Example:

```bash
counter=1
while [ $counter -le 5 ]
do
    echo "Counter is $counter"
    ((counter++))
done
```

**Explanation**:

The loop will continue as long as `counter` is less than or equal to 5.

The `counter` variable is incremented in each iteration.

## Until Loop

An until loop is the opposite of a while loop. It runs the block of code until a certain condition becomes true. It continues running as long as the condition is false.

### Syntax:

```bash
until condition
do
    commands
done
```

### Example:

```bash
counter=1
until [ $counter -gt 5 ]
do
    echo "Counter is $counter"
    ((counter++))
done
```

**Explanation**:

This loop will continue until `counter` is greater than 5, which is the opposite of the while loop condition.

## Loop Control Statements

Sometimes you may want to control the flow of loops more explicitly. There are two important loop control statements: **break** and **continue**.

### Break

The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, stopping further iterations.

### Example:

```bash
for i in {1..10}
do
    if [ $i -eq 5 ]; then
        break
    fi
    echo "Number is $i"
done
```

**Explanation**:

The loop will stop when `i` equals 5. It will print numbers 1 to 4, then exit.

### Continue

The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration and move to the next one. It does not exit the loop completely but skips the remaining code in the current iteration.

### Example:

```bash
for i in {1..5}
do
    if [ $i -eq 3 ]; then
        continue
    fi
    echo "Number is $i"
done
```

**Explanation**:

The loop will print all numbers except for 3 because when `i` equals 3, the continue statement skips the current iteration, and the loop moves to the next value.

## Summary of Loop Types:

- **For Loop**: Use when the number of iterations is known in advance. Works with a list or range.
- **While Loop**: Use when the number of iterations is unknown, but you know the condition to continue.
- **Until Loop**: Use when you want to loop until a condition becomes true.
- **Break**: Used to exit a loop early.
- **Continue**: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next iteration.

By using loops and loop control statements, you can make your programs more efficient and reduce repetitive code.
